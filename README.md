This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Their guidance and valuable insights played a pivotal role in steering us in the right direction and enhancing our project's quality.

During this hackathon, we had the opportunity to explore and learn about various technologies. We want to acknowledge the learning experiences we had with technologies like NEXT.Js and Figma, which significantly enriched our skillset and widened our horizons.

Repo Heaven would not have been possible without the support of the open-source community. We express our gratitude to all the developers and contributors who tirelessly work on the GitHub API and the numerous tools and libraries we utilized to build our project.

Lastly, we want to thank the hackathon organizers and judges for providing us with this platform to showcase our innovation and dedication. Participating in this hackathon has been an incredible journey of growth and learning for us.
